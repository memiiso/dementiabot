##### WORK IN PROGRESS 
AI BOT for dementia patients, a chatbot to answer patients with friendly voice and keep them relaxed and help the caretakers.

# Dementia Bot

The patient's short term memory is impaired and he is unable to register, encode, retain and retrieve the answer. If he is concerned about a particular topic, he will keep asking the same question over and over again.

Repeated questions could cause frustration and arguments. Dementia Bot is used to answer patient with a known voice and used to calm down the patient.
